Gort Service Debugger by Phillip H. Blanton

The Service Debugger is a library that allows you to debug a service easily from within Visual Studio. 

How to use the ServiceDebugger:

1. Include a reference to ServiceDebugger.dll.
 
2.  The service Main() should look like this...

    static void Main()
    {
      ServiceBase[]
      ServicesToRun = new ServiceBase[] { new PluginService() };

      ServiceBase.Run(ServicesToRun);
    }

 Change it as follows

    static void Main()
    {
      ServiceBase[]
      ServicesToRun = new ServiceBase[] { new PluginService() };

      #if (DEBUG)
      Gort.ServiceDebugger.ServiceLoader.StartServices(ServicesToRun);
      #else
      ServiceBase.Run(ServicesToRun);
      #endif
    }

Be sure not to add a using clause to the top of the file for "Gort.ServiceDebugger" as this will 
require the ServiceDebugger dll to be deployed with the service at runtime. As long as the call 
to the ServiceDebugger is compile defined for debug mode, you will not be foreced to deploy the 
ServiceDebugger.dll.
