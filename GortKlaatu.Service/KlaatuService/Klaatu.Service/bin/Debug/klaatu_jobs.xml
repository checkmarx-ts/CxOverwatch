Cron-Expressions are used to configure instances of CronTrigger. 
Cron-Expressions are strings that are actually made up of seven sub-expressions that describe individual 
details of the schedule. These sub-expression are separated with white-space, and represent:
 * Seconds	YES	0-59	, - * /
 * Minutes	YES	0-59	, - * /
 * Hours	YES	0-23	, - * /
 * Day of month	YES	1-31	, - * ? / L W
 * Month	YES	1-12 or JAN-DEC	, - * /
 * Day of week	YES	1-7 or SUN-SAT	, - * ? / L #
 * Year	NO	empty, 1970-2099	, - * /

An example of a complete cron-expression is the string "0 0 12 ? * WED" - which means "every Wednesday at 12:00 pm".

More Examples:
